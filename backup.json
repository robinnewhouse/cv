    "summary": "Hi! I'm Robin. I'm A PhD candidate in experimental particle physics at the University of British Columbia and working with CERN's Large Hadron Collider. I've also got a BSc in Astrophysics, with a minor in Computer Science. I'm particularly interested in machine learning, data science, and scientific software engineering. I have years of experience extracting quantitative insights from enormous datasets. \n \nI'm personable, enthusiastic, and driven to identify and solve problems. My key experience is in data science, machine learning, object-oriented programming, scientific computing, high-energy physics, grid computing, and automated data pipelines. \n \nI look forward to expanding my skills in intelligent automation, cloud platforms, and ML applications in business environments. Ideally, I'd love to use my skills to solve the pressing tasks of stabilizing our environment and advancing renewable energy. \n \nLet's talk about how I can contribute to your organization!",

The site-independent core is complete, active applications have been ported, and now we are in the \nprocess of verification and transitioning to using Open XAL in production. This paper will present the current status and a roadmap for this project. ",
